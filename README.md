# CHING CHING LEE's Front End Developer Intern Application

This is the application to apply for the Front End Developer position at Critical Mass (Calgary) this summer. See the notes below to find out my interests, skills and projects.

## Work / Project Examples

- Lethbridge Food Guide: Please see the link here [Lethbridge Food Guide](https://github.com/leechingching/leth-food-master) to explore the web app.
   
  Role: Web Developer and Designer
  
  Idea: This is version 2.0 of my Food Guide app. Living in Lethbridge is kind of dry for young people and new students since we do not know where to eat and where to hang out with our friends. Or sometimes, we just have no idea where should we dine out. I'd like to make Lethbridge more interesting by providing information to the residents here. Instead of providing specific data to users, this app will provide a random reason to the user. It is fun to explore the city if we get random restaurant information.
  
  This is my first individual web project, I was learning React online after my internship and part-time job. I create custom components to call and render the Zomato API. For this project, my main focus is the functionality and React, therefore, I did not put too much CSS element. The UI design is very similar to my first project, but it is more responsive and dynamic.

- Textbooks of Terrors: Please see the link here [Textbooks of Terrors](http://jekyll.chingchinglee.com/projects/textbooks_of_terrors/) to explore this Education App.

  Role: UI Designer
  
  Idea: 
  The idea behind the app was generated largely at Coalbanks elementary school.  We met with a small group of grade 5 students and spoke with them about the types of apps they used, and what they like about them.  We also spoke to them about what they were learning about in school and what they would like to see in an educational app.  The grade 5s were very vocal about their experiences with apps and what they hoped to see in an app.  From that discussion, we came up with our idea.
   
   The App will take place as a story/adventure game wherein the Coalbanks school mascot Colby (above) will approach the player and ask them to come to Coalbanks school, where the teachers of the school have been taken/imprisoned by their Alter Egos. The player has to save the teachers by exploring the school, finding the teacher’s classrooms and solving various puzzles or questions posed by the Alter Egos of the school. The activities will be linked to the GLOs and SLOs of the Grade 4/5 alberta curriculum. The game is over when all the teachers have been freed. 
  
   Our app is specifically designed for Coalbanks elementary school and their students. Therefore, we will simulate the real environment of the school. The following elements will be included: 

   * Photos of the environment of Coalbanks (such as Hallway, classrooms)
   * Colby as the game’s instructor/helper
   * Cartoon drawing of their teachers
   * Sound effects and animation
   * Missions and Tasks: to solve Academic questions 

   Both audience groups will gain benefits from this app. On the one hand, Coalbanks elementary school can promote their school in a more interesting and modern way. On the other hand, their students can learn useful academic knowledge as well as get additional information about their school. 

   My main role is to design the path of the game, and how/where to put the UI elements in order to lead a logical store flow, and make sure students can understand the functionality of the app.

## Inspiration

## Focus

If I am lucky enough to be select to be one of the team member this summer, I'd love to spend my time learning 1. [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) and 2. [React](https://reactjs.org/), and also mastering my favourite langauge CSS, specifically 3. [CSS GRID](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/css-grid/). I will spend most of my time learning React since the high demand, and I prefer to add CSS Grid to the web project. I will spend my own time to learn PWA, and communciate with other developers to know their opinions and experience on PWA.

1. Since mobile device has dominated the majority of the web market. Most users still spend most of their time playing native apps instead of searching web apps. Therefore, users are not engaged much. With PWA, users can download the app web to their mobile device with one-click, and they can use it whenever they want and take all the main information and function from the web app. I believe it is the future trend of the web development market, and Google has highly promoted this PWA concept. It is always a good idea to learn the new trend and skills as soon as possible in order to launch the PWA when the market is ready.

2. React is one of the popular frameworks, and it is getting more and more built-in functions. The React 16.8 add "Hooks" which makes our lives easier and the app better. React sorta become an industry standard and the requirement of front end developer since a lot of international companies and brands are using React to rewrite their sites. And also, JavaScript and React are improving at the same time, it is interesting to master your javaScript and learning new React features at the same time.

3. CSS is always my favorite markup language as it enchants your sites and makes your sites look different. CSS layout is never an easy job for developers, and mobile device increases the difficulty of CSS layout. Before the CSS group created CSS Grid, we used Float, position, and Flexbox to align our items, and we need to write much fallback codes to support the old browser. It is a pain in the ass to me. Although we can use Bootstrap to solve most of the layout problems, it makes our site boring.

   CSS Grid provides the possibility for us to create a responsive and unique web layout which makes our web apps look awesome and different! With CSS Grid, we can make an awesome layout without adding JavaScript. Also, we can maintain and understand our code easier. As I said before, mobile device is taking over the web market. Therefore, most of the web apps are going to show on a specific resolution and width. Therefore, using CSS Grid can provide a wonderful UI and UX for this environment.

   Nowadays, CSS Grid has better browser support and being one of the popular layout methods. I am so excited to learn the CSS Grid 2.0 (subgrid) and use CSS Grid in a more interesting way.
