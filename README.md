## Inspiration

## Focus

If I am lucky enough to be select to be one of the team member this summer, I'd love to spend my time learning [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), and also mastering my favourite langauge CSS, specifically CSS GRID [https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/css-grid/].
