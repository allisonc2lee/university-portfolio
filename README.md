## Inspiration

## Focus

If I am lucky enough to be select to be one of the team member this summer, I'd love to spend my time learning [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), and also mastering my favourite langauge CSS, specifically [CSS GRID][https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/css-grid/].

1. PWA
   ⋅⋅⋅Since mobile device has dominated the majority of the web market. Most users still spend most of their time playing native apps instead of searching web apps. Therefore, users are not engaged much. With PWA, users can download the app web to their mobile device with one-click, and they can use it whenever they want and take all the main information and function from the web app. I believe it is the future trend of the web development market, and Google has highly promoted this PWA concept. It is always a good idea to learn the new trend and skills as soon as possible in order to launch the PWA when the market is ready.

2. React
   ⋅⋅⋅React is one of the popular frameworks, and it is getting more and more built-in functions. The React 16.8 add "Hooks" which makes our lives easier and the app better. React sorta become an industry standard and the requirement of front end developer since a lot of international companies and brands are using React to rewrite their sites. And also, JavaScript and React are improving at the same time, it is interesting to master your javaScript and learning new React features at the same time.

3. CSS Grid
   ⋅⋅⋅CSS is always my favorite markup language as it enchants your sites and makes your sites look different. CSS layout is never an easy job for developers, and mobile device increases the difficulty of CSS layout. Before the CSS group created CSS Grid, we used Float, position, and Flexbox to align our items, and we need to write much fallback codes to support the old browser. It is a pain in the ass to me. Although we can use Bootstrap to solve most of the layout problems, it makes our site boring.

   ⋅⋅⋅CSS Grid provides the possibility for us to create a responsive and unique web layout which makes our web apps look awesome and different! With CSS Grid, we can make an awesome layout without adding JavaScript. Also, we can maintain and understand our code easier. As I said before, mobile device is taking over the web market. Therefore, most of the web apps are going to show on a specific resolution and width. Therefore, using CSS Grid can provide a wonderful UI and UX for this environment.

   ⋅⋅⋅Nowadays, CSS Grid has better browser support and being one of the popular layout methods. I am so excited to learn the CSS Grid 2.0 (subgrid) and use CSS Grid in a more interesting way.
